**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for creating native Python bindings for the Anda DB module. The goal is to expose the KIP (Knowledge Interaction Protocol) execution functionality, currently implemented in Rust within `anda_engine`, to the Python ecosystem.

### 1.2. Project Goal
The primary objective is to allow Python applications and AI agents to interact with an agent's persistent memory (Anda DB) with near-native performance. This will be achieved by creating a Python package that directly calls the underlying Rust library, eliminating network latency and providing a seamless, Pythonic developer experience.

### 1.3. Scope
**In Scope:**
-   Creation of a new Rust crate responsible for the Python bindings.
-   Exposing a single Python function, `execute_kip`, with the specified signature.
-   Translating Rust `Result::Err` and `panic!`s into catchable Python exceptions.
-   Configuration of the build system to produce a Python wheel (`.whl`) file installable via `pip`.
-   Basic unit tests to validate the bindings.

---

## 2. System Architecture & Technology Stack

This project will use a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) architecture. The Rust core logic will be compiled into a dynamic shared library that the Python interpreter can load and execute in the same process.

-   **Core Language:** Rust (for the existing Anda DB logic)
-   **Binding Generation:** `pyo3` crate for creating the Rust-to-Python interface.
-   **Build & Packaging:** `maturin` for building and packaging the Rust code into a Python wheel.
-   **Target Language:** Python (version 3.8+)

## 3. Functional Requirements

### FR-01: Python Module
A new Python module, provisionally named `anda`, shall be created. This module will be the entry point for all functionality exposed from the Rust core.

### FR-02: Core `execute_kip` Function
The module shall expose a primary function with the following signature and behavior, derived from the initial specification:

```python
def execute_kip(
    command: str,
    *,
    parameters: dict | None = None,
    dry_run: bool = False
) -> dict:
    """
    Executes a KIP (Knowledge Interaction Protocol) command against the 
    Cognitive Nexus to interact with your persistent memory.

    Args:
        command: A complete, multi-line KIP command (KQL, KML or META) 
                 string to be executed.
        parameters: An optional JSON object of key-value pairs used for safe 
                    substitution of placeholders in the command string. 
                    Placeholders in the command should start with a '$' 
                    (e.g., $name, $limit).
        dry_run: If set to true, the command will only be validated for 
                 syntactical and logical correctness without being executed.

    Returns:
        A dictionary representing the JSON response from the KIP engine.

    Raises:
        AndaError: If the KIP engine returns an error or a panic occurs 
                   in the underlying Rust code.
    """
```
- **FR-2.1:** The function must accept the `command` as a positional argument.
- **FR-2.2:** `parameters` and `dry_run` must be keyword-only arguments.
- **FR-2.3:** The `parameters` dictionary shall be used for safe variable substitution in the Rust core before KIP command execution.
- **FR-2.4:** The `dry_run` flag shall be passed to the Rust core to trigger validation-only logic.

### FR-03: Error Handling
The system shall provide robust error handling by translating Rust errors into Python exceptions.
- **FR-3.1:** A custom Python exception class, `AndaError`, shall be defined in the `anda` module.
- **FR-3.2:** Any `Result::Err` returned by the Rust KIP engine shall be converted into an `AndaError` exception in Python, with the error message from Rust included in the exception message.
- **FR-3.3:** Any `panic!` in the Rust binding code shall be caught and raised as an `AndaError` to prevent the Python interpreter from crashing.

### FR-04: Data Type Conversion
Data types shall be seamlessly converted between Python and Rust.
-   Python `str` <-> Rust `String`
-   Python `dict` <-> Rust `HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>`
-   Python `bool` <-> Rust `bool`
-   The return value from Rust (likely a `serde_json::Value` or a struct) shall be converted into a Python `dict`.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-01: Performance
Function calls from Python to Rust shall have minimal overhead. The performance should be benchmarked as being significantly faster than an equivalent local HTTP request.

### NFR-02: Build & Packaging
The project must be configured to be built using `maturin`.
- **NFR-2.1:** The command `maturin build --release` shall successfully produce a `.whl` file in the `target/wheels` directory.
- **NFR-2.2:** The resulting wheel must be installable in a Python virtual environment using `pip install <wheel_file>`.

### NFR-03: Documentation
The public Python function (`execute_kip`) and the `AndaError` class must have clear, comprehensive docstrings, as outlined in **FR-02**.

### NFR-04: Testing
A suite of unit tests shall be developed using the `pytest` framework.
- **NFR-4.1:** Tests must verify successful execution of a simple KIP command.
- **NFR-4.2:** Tests must verify that a syntactically incorrect KIP command raises an `AndaError`.
- **NFR-4.3:** Tests must verify the correct behavior of the `dry_run` flag.
- **NFR-4.4:** Tests must verify the correct substitution of `parameters`.

## 5. Project Plan (High-Level Milestones)

1.  **Phase 1: Toolchain Setup & Project Scaffolding**
    -   Add `pyo3` and other necessary dependencies to a new or existing `Cargo.toml`.
    -   Create a new Rust crate (e.g., `anda_py`) to house the binding logic.
    -   Configure `maturin` in `pyproject.toml`.
    -   Create a "hello world" binding to confirm the build process is working.

2.  **Phase 2: Core Logic Implementation**
    -   Implement the `execute_kip` wrapper function in the new Rust crate.
    -   Wire the function to the actual KIP execution logic in `anda_engine::memory`.
    -   Handle the data type conversions for arguments and return values.

3.  **Phase 3: Error Handling & Testing**
    -   Implement the `Result::Err` and `panic!` to `AndaError` translation.
    -   Develop the `pytest` test suite in a `/tests` directory.

4.  **Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization**
    -   Write and refine all docstrings.
    -   Update the main project `README.md` with instructions on how to build and install the Python package.
    -   Perform a final review of the code and documentation.
