The `anda_engine/src/memory.rs` file provides a comprehensive memory management system for the Anda engine with the following key features:

## Core Data Structures

### 1. **Conversation Management**
The `Conversation` struct stores complete conversation histories with:
- User identification via `Principal`
- Thread grouping support
- Message history as JSON objects
- Resource attachments (input documents)
- Generated artifacts (output resources)
- Status tracking (`ConversationStatus`: Submitted, Working, Completed, Canceled, Failed)
- LLM usage statistics
- Time-based indexing for efficient retrieval

### 2. **KIP Logs Storage**
The `KIPLogs` struct records Knowledge Interface Protocol interactions:
- User-specific logging
- Command type tracking
- Request/response pairs
- Conversation association
- Time-based organization

### 3. **Resource Management**
Handles external resources and documents with:
- Binary blob storage
- URI references
- Metadata tracking
- Hash-based deduplication

## Memory Management System

The `MemoryManagement` struct provides centralized access to:

### Database Collections
- **Conversations collection**: Stores all conversation data with BTree indexes on user, thread, and period fields, plus BM25 full-text search
- **KIP logs collection**: Tracks all KIP protocol interactions
- **Resources collection**: Manages shared resources with deduplication

### Key Operations

#### Conversation Operations
- `add_conversation()`: Create new conversations
- `update_conversation()`: Update existing conversations
- `get_conversation()`: Retrieve by ID
- `list_conversations_by_user()`: Paginated user conversation listing
- `search_conversations()`: Full-text search across conversations
- `delete_expired_conversations()`: Cleanup old conversations and associated resources

#### Resource Operations
- `add_resource()`: Store new resources
- `try_add_resources()`: Batch resource addition with deduplication
- `get_resource()`: Retrieve resources by ID

#### System Integration
- `describe_primer()`: Get system primer information
- `describe_system()`: Get system identity and domains

## Tool Implementations

The module implements several tools that can be used by the agent:

### 1. **KIP Tool**
Executes KIP commands and automatically logs them with conversation context.

### 2. **GetResourceContentTool**
Retrieves resource content as text, handling:
- Binary to base64 conversion
- UTF-8 text extraction
- Remote URI fetching

### 3. **ListConversationsTool**
Lists previous conversations with pagination support and formatted datetime output.

### 4. **SearchConversationsTool**
Performs full-text search across user conversations.

### 5. **MemoryTool**
A comprehensive memory API tool supporting:
- Resource retrieval with conversation context validation
- Conversation retrieval and stopping
- Previous conversation listing
- Conversation searching
- KIP log listing

## Key Features

### Indexing Strategy
- **BTree indexes** for fast lookups by user, thread, and time period
- **BM25 indexes** for full-text search capabilities
- **Period-based partitioning** (hourly buckets) for efficient time-range queries

### Security & Permissions
- User-based access control (conversations are user-specific)
- Permission checks in tool implementations
- Resource ownership validation

### Data Lifecycle
- Automatic timestamping (created_at, updated_at)
- Conversation status management
- Expired conversation cleanup with cascading resource deletion

### Integration Points
- **CognitiveNexus**: For concept and meta-command execution
- **AndaDB**: For persistent storage with schema validation
- **Jieba tokenizer**: For Chinese text segmentation in search
- **Tool system**: Exposes memory operations as agent tools

This memory module essentially provides a complete conversation history and resource management system, enabling the agent to maintain context, search past interactions, and manage associated documents efficiently.
